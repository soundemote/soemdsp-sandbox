Boundaries:

```text
The server only writes through explicit save/settings/audio helper routes.
Open Path is restricted to Downloads.
The browser patch graph is demo-scoped state.
The browser compiler is not the production soemdsp scheduler.
The WebUI does not instantiate real C++ DSP objects yet.
Patch files can save current module instances and settings.
Patch files cannot define new module types by themselves.
```
