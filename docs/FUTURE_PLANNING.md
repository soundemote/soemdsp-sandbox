# Future Planning Notes

This file collects project-shaping ideas that should survive day-to-day implementation without becoming immediate scope.

## Slider buffered modulation (destination = real effective-param history)

Parked under **0.5.0 RGB**. First visual when we return: live occupancy + caret on the value axis, not a mini-scope. Do not implement until asked.

Primary note:

docs/SLIDER_BUFFERED_MODULATION_PLAN.md
```

## Lo-Fi Pitch Shift (component-first)

Realtime pitch tools aimed at **abusable lo-fi character**, not transparent stretch. Build lowest modules first (buffer → varispeed → grains → grain pitch → optional spectral dirt), each useful alone, then compose.

Primary note:

docs/LOFI_PITCH_SHIFT_PLAN.md
```

## Dropdown Window Buttons

Next version: consider turning Command Center buttons into dropdowns instead of opening separate floating windows for every tool.

The current floating-window direction is good enough for this release. The next pass can consolidate window bodies into button-owned dropdown panels, because the panels are already starting to look and behave like compact modules.

Keep this as a next-version cleanup, not a release blocker.

## Inlets / outlets above displays (app-wide)

**Implemented.** LayoutA (and sample / phosphor face stacks) use `header → io → face → params → lip`. Display off and Display Height 0 omit the face track; I/O stays under the header.

Standing rule: `docs/APP_POLICY.md` (LayoutA I/O above the face). Band contract: `docs/MODULE_LAYOUT_PLAN.md`.

LayoutB (ports beside the face) and InletOutletLayout (title + I/O, no face) are unchanged. Do not add a second layout or an old-patch shim for the previous face-then-I/O stack.
